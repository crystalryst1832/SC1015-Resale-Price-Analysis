# SC1015-Resale-Price-Analysis
Our team's objective is to analyse the factors that affect resale prices of HDB in Singapore, from 2017 to 2024's first month. For detailed walkthrough, please view code in order from:
1. Data Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) which are further split into:
   
   A. Numerical Variables.       
   B. Categorical Variables.  
   C. CLustering.  
   D. Geolocation.  
   E. Variable: distance_to_mrt_m.
   
4. Machine Learning which contains:
   
   A. Regression.  
   B. Classification.  
   
## Problem Definition
Are the claims according to public perception about HDB really true?
- Larger floor areas tend to fetch higher resale prices.  
- Older flats (40+ years old) are assumed to be less desirable and cheaper.  
- Premium flat models (eg: Premium Apartment, DBSS, Improved) tend to fetch higher prices.  
- Larger flat types (5-room) are expected to have higher prices, because they offer more space.  
- Flats based on certain streets might be assumed to be higher prices, due to high demand and accessibility.  
- Higher floors (19 to 21, 22 to 24) are believed to have higher prices, due to better views, privacy, less noise compared to lower floors.  
- The nearer the distance to the nearest MRT, the higher the resale price, due to greater accessibility.

# Insights
### Larger floor areas are the most demanded -- Not Always

- Older flats (40+ years old) are assumed to be less desirable and cheaper.  
- Premium flat models (eg: Premium Apartment, DBSS, Improved) tend to fetch higher prices.  
- Larger flat types (5-room) are expected to have higher prices, because they offer more space.  
- Flats based on certain streets might be assumed to be higher prices, due to high demand and accessibility.  
- Higher floors (19 to 21, 22 to 24) are believed to have higher prices, due to better views, privacy, less noise compared to lower floors.  
- The nearer the distance to the nearest MRT, the higher the resale price, due to greater accessibility.  

# What is something new that we learn?


# Last Words
We hope in the future we can look into Machine Learning models that combine both categorical and numerical factors and discover unforeseen trends when doing so.
