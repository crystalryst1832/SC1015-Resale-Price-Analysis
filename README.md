# SC1015-Resale-Price-Analysis
Our team's objective is to analyse the factors that affect resale prices of HDB in Singapore, from 2017 to 2024's first month. For detailed walkthrough, please view code in order from:
1. Data Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) which are further split into:
   
   A. Numerical Variables.       
   B. Categorical Variables.  
   C. CLustering.  
   D. Geolocation.  
   E. Variable: distance_to_mrt_m.
   
4. Machine Learning which contains:
   
   A. Regression.  
   B. Classification.  
   
## Problem Definition
Are the claims according to public perception about HDB really true?
- Larger floor areas tend to fetch higher resale prices.  
- Older flats (40+ years old) are assumed to be less desirable and cheaper.  
- Premium flat models (eg: Premium Apartment, DBSS, Improved) tend to fetch higher prices.  
- Larger flat types (5-room) are expected to have higher prices, because they offer more space.  
- Higher floors (19 to 21, 22 to 24) are believed to have higher prices, due to better views, privacy, less noise compared to lower floors.  
- The nearer the distance to the nearest MRT, the higher the resale price, due to greater accessibility.

# Insights
### "Larger floor areas are the most demanded" -- Not Always
<p align= 'center'>
   <img src="FloorAreaVsResalePrice.jpg" width='400'>
It suggests high supply =/ highest price. 
The volume of HDB is demand-driven, rather than value-per-unit-size. 
Even though larger flats are rare, they command higher average prices -- possibly due to exclusive flat types. 
</p>

### "Older flats (40+ years old) are assumed to be less desirable and cheaper." -- False  
<p align= 'center'>
   <img src="RemainingLeaseVersusResalePrice.jpg" width='400'>
The linear regression between the remaining_lease in terms of months and resale price has a poor predictive power, R^2 is 0.1. 
Contrary to public perception, the age of flats, or in other words the remaining lease, weakly affects the resale prices.
There are other more domineering factors in play.
</p>

### Premium flat models (eg: Premium Apartment, DBSS, Improved) tend to fetch higher prices. -- True

### Larger flat types (5-room) are expected to have higher prices, because they offer more space. -- True but Demand is not the highest

### Higher floors (19 to 21, 22 to 24) are believed to have higher prices, due to better views, privacy, less noise compared to lower floors. -- Not ALways
<p align= 'center'>
   <img src="StoreyvsPrice.jpg" width='400'>
There are constant outliers for the lower storey ranges, and they fetch high resale prices.
</p>

### The nearer the distance to the nearest MRT, the higher the resale price, due to greater accessibility. -- Not Always
<p align= 'center'>
   <img src="DistanceMRTvsPrice.jpg" width='400'>
The picture above shows resale prices relating to their distances to MRT stations, with blue dots representing listings, highlighting spatial proximity and pricing. Here, a house of 190 metres away gives a lower price of 630 000 than a house of 700 metres away which is valued at 750 000, demonstrating not all houses are more expensive when they are nearer to the MRT, contradicting popular belief.

# What is something new that we learn?
- The importance of Data Cleaning and how it impacts Accuracy and Correlation between factors
- Geolocation
- API Usage, to fetch coordinates of full addresses of a large database containing thousands of addresses
- Regression
- Cat Boost Classifier

# Last Words
We hope in the future we can look into Machine Learning models that combine both categorical and numerical factors and discover unforeseen trends when doing so.
